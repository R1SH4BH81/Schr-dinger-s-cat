# Schrödinger's Cat Game

## Overview
Schrödinger's Cat Game is a text-based guessing game implemented in Python. The game is inspired by the famous thought experiment proposed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger.

In this game, players are presented with a sealed box containing a cat. The cat's state (alive or dead) is uncertain until the player makes a guess. The player's task is to guess the state of the cat without opening the box.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script `schrodingers_cat_game.py`.
2. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen.
3. Guess whether you think the cat inside the box is alive or dead.
4. The game will reveal the actual state of the cat and inform you if your guess was correct.
5. Decide whether you want to play again.

## Game Mechanics
- The state of the cat (alive or dead) is determined randomly at the beginning of each game.
- Players input their guesses through the command line interface.
- After guessing, the game reveals the actual state of the cat.
- Players can choose to play multiple rounds of the game.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x+
